ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Faris, a dual-degree student at UNLV studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science. I'm especially passionate about cybersecurity and love exploring how it connects with AI, VR, and robotics. Iâ€™m always looking for ways to stay ahead in the tech space. Right now, Iâ€™m sharpening my skills through hands-on projects and certifications in cybersecurity, and I enjoy building real-world tools that make an impact. Iâ€™ve worked on everything from VR-based robot simulations to teaching cybersecurity to student teams, and Iâ€™m constantly pushing myself to learn something new. I thrive in collaborative environments where I can apply my skills, grow through challenges, and help bring innovative ideas to life. If youâ€™re working on something cool â€” or want to build something together â€” feel free to reach out. Letâ€™s make something great.
